# modellwerkstatt.org DesktopGridPro Component

Our DesktopGridPro component brings the UX of desktop data grids to the Vaadin ecosystem. Java desktop toolkits like
apache pivot, java fx or the classic eclipse swt always have extensive options for working with data tables. Typically,
keyobard navigation in the table is very well supported - an essential feature for power users. There are one or
several selected rows. With arrow up / down the selected row can be changed. A mouse click changes the selected row as well, etc., etc.
If a context menu is available, the right mouse button calls this menu. Actions can then be called for the "selected line".

The Vaadin GridPro follows a different UX. We adapt the behavior of the GridPro to the conventional desktop experience.
